# Simulating the Lewis Signalling Game

The code is this repository simulates the Lewis signalling game using neural networks as agents in an attempt to argue against the game as a model of the minimal conditions for the evolution of meaning. The full argument is laid in [this paper](https://elijahsandler.com/projects/simulating-lsg/).

Code for all graphs used in the paper, as well as sankey diagrams to show how the agents make decisions, are in `lewis_reinforcement.ipynb`. `sankey.py` is a wrapper for [Plotly's sankey diagram functionality](https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/) and should not be edited unless the user is comfortable with the code.
